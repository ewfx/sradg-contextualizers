There are also numerous instances of 'Consistent' classifications, suggesting periods of alignment. Anomaly status is overwhelmingly 'No,' but when present, it's often related to 'Sudden spike in Difference due to GL Balance' or 'Balance turned negative'. There's a prevalence of 'consistent decrease in difference' classifications, where the Ihub Balance is greater than the GL Balance, leading to a negative difference. There are also a few instances of 'Balance turned positive' and 'Sudden spike in Difference due to GL Balance' classifications, which are marked as anomalies. The data spans from 01-01-2025 to 03-01-2025, with a higher density of entries on 01-01-2025 and 02-01-2025 compared to 03-01-2025.
